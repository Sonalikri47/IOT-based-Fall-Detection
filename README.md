# IOT-based-Fall-Detection

The project aims to detect falls in elderly people or individuals at risk of falling.

Hardware Implementation:
1. NodeMCU ESP8266
2. MPU6050 sensor
3. Breadboard
4. Jumper wires
5. Micro USB cable

Software Implementation:
1. Arduino IDE
2. IFTTT

Used a NodeMCU ESP8266 board and a MPU6050 sensor to collect data on acceleration and angular velocity. By analyzing this data, we can detect sudden changes in motion that are characteristic of a fall event. When a fall is detected, an alert message is sent through Wi-Fi to a mobile app or web server. This project can improve the safety and well-being of vulnerable populations by providing timely notification of fall events.
